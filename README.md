How It Works:
HTML: Provides the structure, including a textarea for input and a button to initiate the scan.
CSS: Styles the application, giving it a clean and user-friendly interface.
JavaScript: Contains a list of common scam keywords. When the "Scan for Scams" button is clicked, the text input is scanned for these keywords. If any are found, it alerts the user that scam indicators were detected.
Enhancements:
Dynamic Keyword Update: Allow the list of scam keywords to be updated or expanded through user input or external sources.
Link Scanning: Identify and flag suspicious URLs.
Machine Learning: Integrate a simple machine learning model to detect scam patterns more effectively.
Reports: Generate a detailed report on why a message might be a scam, highlighting specific phrases or links.
This basic example should help you get started with creating a more sophisticated scam scanner application.
